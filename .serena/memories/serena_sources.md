# Serena Sources to Add for This Project

The Agent_Instructions suggests adding the following sources into Serena for easier reference during refactor work:

- https://github.com/QuantumPhysique/trale  (original repo)  
- https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/getting-started/  (Drift docs)  
- https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/getting-started/advanced_dart_tables/  (Drift advanced tables)  
- https://pub.dev/packages/camera  (camera plugin docs)  
- https://pub.dev/packages/table_calendar  (calendar UI)  
- https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_colorpicker  (color picker docs)  
- https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests  (integration tests guide)

Add these resources as Serena sources/collections named `trale_database`, `trale_ui`, and `trale_testing` as described in `Agent_Instructions.md`.
