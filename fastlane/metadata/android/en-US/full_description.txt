<b>Disclaimer</b>
Anorexia is a serious disease. 
Especially due to the many negative examples in social media, 
anorexia is increasingly a problem for society as a whole. 
In order to make our contribution to prevention, 
no target weight below 50 kg / 110 lb / 7.9 st is possible.

This app is still in <b>beta</b> stage and may contain bugs.
It should work best with FHD/FHD+ resolution.
