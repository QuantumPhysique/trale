<b>Disclaimer</b>
Anorexia is a serious disease. Especially due to the many negative examples in
the social media, anorexia is increasingly a problem for society as a whole. In
order to make our contribution to prevention, no target weight below 50 kg /
110 lb / 7.9 st is possible.

This app is still in <b>beta</b> stage and may contain bugs. It should work
best with FHD/FHD+ resolution. If you encounter a bug or if you are missing a
feature, please <a href="https://github.com/quantumphysique/trale/-/issues">open a new issue</a>.
